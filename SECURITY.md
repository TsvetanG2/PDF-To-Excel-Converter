## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can report a vulerability either by directly getting in touch with me.
Please keep in mind, that this is a demo version of the app. It is made to run on local level.

In case of security breach due to the use of the app in production env, we do not take any responsibilities.
The publishing as production app or the use of the code as add-on feature is at your own risk.

You can feel free to develop the current version to the point, where you can use it in prod, but again at your own risk!
